            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Greek rice pudding is simple, comforting, and delicious. Some people in Greece make it with eggs, but my aunt prefers without. Best enjoyed cold - if you can wait that long!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups water</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon groubd cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered very slowly, stirring occasionally, until most of the water has been absorbed and rice is soft, about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour 2 cups milk and sugar into the saucepan and increase heat to high.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, stir together 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Once rice-milk mixture is boiling, add cornstarch mixture and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Ladle rice pudding into individual serving dishes and sprinkle with cinnamon. Allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours.</li>
                </ol>
